# Predicting Presidential Elections at the State Level
![](images/map_header.PNG)

# Project Overview

Throughout history we have seen changes in how different states vote in elections. What makes a state red or blue? Our goal is to determine the answer to this question by using our data sources to see they somehow correlate with the outcome of previous elections. If accurate, we believe that we can utilize our model to predict future elections.
